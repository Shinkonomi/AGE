![alt text](https://github.com/shinkonomi/ARE/images/ARELogo.png "All Star Render Engine")

### ARE is a simple modular real-time render engine with a great emphasize on being used in game engines
#### This render engine is created with the OpenGL graphics API and it is a personal project for testing different algorithms in real-time computer graphics specifically for game engines use cases

### **CURRENTLY THIS PROJECT IS ON CONSTANT TESTING SO THIS IS STILL A BINARY BASED PROJECT AND NOT A LIBRARY!!!**

## Building it

1. First make sure that the latest driver for your graphics card is installed on your operating system
2. Install the latest version of visual studio 2022
3. Open the **ARE.sln** solution file and put the VS debugger on **release** mode (make sure that you're on x64) and then on the **Solution Explorer** window right click on **ARE** and click on **build**
4. After the solution is built navigate to x64/Release and there should be an executable on this folder
